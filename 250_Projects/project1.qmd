### Elevator Pitch

In this analysis, we explore the historical trends of popular names and how certain names gained or declined in popularity over time. We specifically investigate common Christian names and examine how the release of a popular movie affected the usage of a unique name. This analysis provides insights into societal influences on name choices.

### Data Preparation

```{python}
# Load libraries and set up LetsPlot
import pandas as pd
from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html(isolated_frame=True)

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv")

Question 1: Name Usage Over Time
How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?

{python}
Copy code
#| label: my-name-trend
#| code-summary: Trend analysis for personal name
# Filter the data for my name (replace "YourName" with the actual name)
name = "YourName"
name_trend = df[df["name"] == name]

# Plot usage over time
ggplot(name_trend, aes(x="year", y="count")) + geom_line() + ggtitle(f"Usage of the Name '{name}' Over Time") + \
    labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")
Written Analysis:

The usage of my name shows [describe any trends or observations]. Its popularity [increased/decreased] significantly in the [decade(s)], suggesting [potential societal factors or trends].

Question 2: Age Guess for Brittany
If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of their age? What ages would you not guess?

{python}
Copy code
#| label: brittany-trend
#| code-summary: Trend analysis for name Brittany
# Filter data for the name Brittany
brittany_trend = df[df["name"] == "Brittany"]

# Plot usage over time
ggplot(brittany_trend, aes(x="year", y="count")) + geom_line(color="blue") + ggtitle("Usage of the Name 'Brittany' Over Time") + \
    labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")
Written Analysis:

Based on the usage trend of the name Brittany, it reached peak popularity during [specific years]. I would guess that someone named Brittany is likely between [age range] and would not guess they are [other age ranges].

Question 3: Christian Names Analysis
Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names in a single chart. What trends do you notice?

{python}
Copy code
#| label: christian-names-trend
#| code-summary: Christian names trend comparison
# Filter data for the selected Christian names from 1920 to 2000
names = ["Mary", "Martha", "Peter", "Paul"]
christian_names_trend = df[(df["name"].isin(names)) & (df["year"] >= 1920) & (df["year"] <= 2000)]

# Plot usage over time for each name
ggplot(christian_names_trend, aes(x="year", y="count", color="name")) + geom_line() + \
    ggtitle("Usage of Christian Names (1920-2000)") + labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")
Written Analysis:

Observing these names from 1920 to 2000, [discuss noticeable patterns for each name, e.g., Maryâ€™s popularity, any declines, and periods of increase]. The trends likely reflect [cultural or historical influences].

Question 4: Name from a Famous Movie
Think of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?

{python}
Copy code
#| label: movie-name-trend
#| code-summary: Name trend influenced by movie
# Replace "FamousMovieName" with the actual name chosen
movie_name = "FamousMovieName"
movie_name_trend = df[df["name"] == movie_name]

# Plot usage over time with a reference line for the movie release year
movie_release_year = 1995  # replace with actual release year of the movie
ggplot(movie_name_trend, aes(x="year", y="count")) + geom_line(color="green") + \
    geom_vline(xintercept=movie_release_year, color="red", linetype="dashed") + \
    ggtitle(f"Usage of the Name '{movie_name}' Over Time") + labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")
Written Analysis:

The name [MovieName] shows a [significant rise/decline] in popularity after the release of [movie name]. This suggests that [the movie likely influenced its popularity].

Stretch Question: Reproduce the Chart for the Name Elliot
Reproduce the chart Elliot using the data from the names_year.csv file.

{python}
Copy code
#| label: elliot-trend
#| code-summary: Reproduce chart for the name Elliot
# Filter data for the name Elliot
elliot_trend = df[df["name"] == "Elliot"]

# Plot usage over time
ggplot(elliot_trend, aes(x="year", y="count")) + geom_line(color="purple") + \
    ggtitle("Usage of the Name 'Elliot' Over Time") + labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")
Written Analysis:

The popularity of the name Elliot demonstrates [describe any observed patterns].
